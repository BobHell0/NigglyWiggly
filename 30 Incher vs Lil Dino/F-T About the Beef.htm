    <section style="margin-left:10%">

        <p>This is Buck-Buck. Lil Dino's chicken. 12/12 8BCE. That night, Buck-Buck was gruesomely sliced into 86 pieces of chick meat.
            Dino, distraught, blamed 30 Incher who had been seen in the area. But, 30 claimed that he had just been playing with his willy at the the time. However,  
        upon further inspection, it had been discoverd that under the fleshy appendage, rested a butcher's knife, slick with blood.
    And 30 confessed, detailing how Buck-Buck's father had placed 30's best friend and lover under arrest for counterfeit lap dances and 30 had killed Buck-Buck in some twisted
    attempt at revenge. 
</p>
<p>Now, the warring between 30 and Dino sees no end. Despite the lack of violence, the insults that have been slung at each other has 
    caused many to lose their homes over the sheer amount of emotional damage that has occured, especially in recent times.
 </p>
 <p>Wil the two ever be able to forgive each other? Will the remains of their friendship find solace? Probs not. Oh well.</p>
