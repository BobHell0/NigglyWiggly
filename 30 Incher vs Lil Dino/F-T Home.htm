    <p style="text-align:center;font-size:24px;">The beef between 30 Incher and Lil Dino has raged on for millenia.</p>
    <section style="margin-left:10%">
    <p>It is always sad news when war is declared. Sides are picked. People forgotten. Lives lost. 
        But that is not the case for this war. You see this war is one of <text style="color:blue">intelletual prowess</text>, not physical ability. 
        <text style="color:red;">Strength</text> is not valued here. Rather, the ability to absolutely pulverise your enemy with wit and something close to genius is preferred. 
    </p>
    <hr style="color:green">
    <p><text style="font-size:26px">Beef</text> is delicious as seen here: </p>
    <br>
    <img src="images/Beef.jpeg" style="width:30%; height:240px;">
    
    <p>But vegan beef is not. It can be difficult to take the 30-Dino beef seriously, due to the serious
        lack of real beefiness that the two possess. However, looks can be deceiving and it is always important to taste your beef and ensure 
        that it has the right amount of spice. </p>
        
        <p>If there is not enough spin on the ball, then the revolutions per second can be devestating.
        However with the right marinade, the flavour can be really brought out. These two have seriously understood the assignment with poise and grace.
        The question is who will be the beef victor and who will fall flat like a <text style="font-size:26px;">pancake?</text>
